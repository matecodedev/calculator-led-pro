 * Pitch against the room it has to be seen from.

 * costs the most: a pitch too coarse and the front row sees the pixels, a pitch
 * too fine and the client pays for resolution nobody in the room can resolve.
 *
 * Two numbers, and they are not the same kind of thing:
 *
 * - The retina distance is geometry. A 20/20 eye resolves about one arcminute,
 *   so two adjacent pixels merge at 3.44 m per millimetre of pitch. Nothing
 *   about the trade changes it.
 * - The minimum is the trade's own rule of thumb — pitch in millimetres read as
 *   metres — for the closest seat people accept. It is a convention, and it is
 *   labelled as one wherever it is shown.
