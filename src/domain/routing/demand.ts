 * What the drawn plan actually costs in cables and processors.

 * the floor, which regularly needs one more cable than the arithmetic minimum.
 * The report was printing "3 main data cables" over a schematic that drew four.
 *
 * The crew loads what the drawing shows, so the drawing is the number that
 * ships. Counting the runs is the only way the two cannot disagree.
