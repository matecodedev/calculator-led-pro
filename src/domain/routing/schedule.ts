/**
 * The pull sheet: how much cable the plan actually needs.
 *
 * The routing says how many cables. It never said how long, so the number that
 * decides whether the truck carries enough was the one thing the app would not
 * tell you — and running short of cable is discovered at load-in, in front of
 * everybody, with no way to fix it.
 *
 * A main is measured from the source to the first cabinet it feeds: across the
 * floor, up to the bottom of the screen, and then up to the run's own start,
 * which is why a stacked run's main is longer than the one under it.
