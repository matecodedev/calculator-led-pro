/**
 * What the screen weighs, and where that weight lands.
 *
 * The app already treats current as something that can hurt someone — derated
 * breakers, a reserved alarm colour, a total against the venue feed. Weight is
 * the other hazard in this trade and it was a single figure with no decision
 * attached to it: "510 kg" tells a rigger nothing they can act on.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this is arithmetic on a declared rig, not a structural
 * calculation. It can say a screen asks 85 kg of each of six points. It cannot
 * say the truss, the motor or the bumper will take it — that is signed for by
 * someone qualified, and the app never pretends otherwise.
